<h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>

<p><em>Responsive web design</em> is a new design philosophy that is
different from fixed design. In responsive web design, page layouts 
adjust according to the size of the end user's display; in fixed 
design, sizes of fonts, box elements and images remain unchanged.</p>

<p>In the past, only desktop and laptop computers were used to surf 
the web. It was a given that screen resolutions would be 1024 pixels 
wide or higher. Fixed grid CSS frameworks such as 
<a href="http://960.gs/">960 Grid System</a> were used to design 
pages that were laid out in even columns on a fixed-width grid, 
usually centered on the screen. As mobile devices began to hit the 
market, it became necessary to create web pages that would work on 
many devices and resolutions. As the number of devices grows 
(watches that surf the web are on the horizon), the more important 
it will be to write responsive sites.</p>

<h2>Mobile First Design</h2>

<p><em>Mobile first design</em> is the next step in responsive web 
design. In mobile first design, the primary CSS is written for mobile.
Then, the cascade later contains media queries that add more code for 
larger device resolutions.</p>

<h3>Better mobile first web design</h3>

<p>Some designers write their CSS media queries so that they only 
affect resolutions that are between two specific break points:</p>

<pre>
h3 {
    font-size: 1.75em; 
}

@media (min-width: 321px) and (max-width: 480px) {
    h3 {
        font-size: 2em;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This approach is severely limiting. What if there was CSS code 
that is useful for <em>all</em> resolutions above 320 pixels, 
including those 480 pixels and above? Writing media queries in this
way means that some code will need to be redeclared later.</p>

<p>We will try a different approach. Our media queries will 
gradually add to the style of the page the larger the resolution 
goes, like this:</p>

<pre>
h3 {
    font-size: 1.75em;
}

@media (min-width: 321px) {
    h3 {
        font-size: 2em;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>See the difference? If an h3 size of 2em happens to work in every 
browser width above 320 pixels, we're in good shape.</p>

<h3>Features of Fixed Design</h3>
<ul>
   <li>A fixed page width in pixels, often centered in the browser 
      window.</li>
   <li>Images are set at fixed widths.</li>
   <li>Font sizes are set at fixed pixel or point sizes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features of Responsive Design</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Page and box element widths are set in percentages.</li>
    <li>Image widths are set with percentages, often at 100% to 
        fill available width.</li>
    <li>Font sizes are set with em sizes, so that they are sized 
        relative to the parent element's font size.</li>
    <li>The primary style sheet is for desktop devices, and media 
        queries are used toward the end of the cascade to account 
        for mobile devices.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features of Mobile First Design</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The primary style sheet is for mobile devices, and media 
        queries are used toward the end of the cascade for tablet, 
        then desktop devices.</li>
    <li>As a result of this change, web site interfaces are 
        simpler and their design is much cleaner. There is far 
        less CSS to write.</li>
